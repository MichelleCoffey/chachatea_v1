## Deployment 
### Github

### Requirements 
  1. Python3 
  2. Github account
  3. Mongo db account
  4. Flask 
  5. heroku account


#### The repository is hosted on GitHub but deployed on Heroku
To make a local clone on Github, follow the following steps.

1. Log in to GitHub and go to the repository.
2. Click on the green button with the text “Code”.
3. Click on “Open with GitHub Desktop” and follow the prompts in the GitHub Desktop Application for instructions.     
4. For further options and documentation please click [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository#cloning-a-repository-to-github-desktop).
  
#### Working with the local copy.
  1. Install all of the requirements. In the terminal window of your IDE type

     **pip3 install -r requirements.txt**

  2. Create a databae in Mongo db. 
      * Sign up or login. 
      * Create a cluster and a database. 
      * Create cluster for family_recipes and in it create a further three collections: user, categories, and recipes. Add string values for each. 
  3. Create the variables. 
    * Create a env.py file by typing **touch env.py**
    * Create a gitignore file and add the env.py to the gitignore to ensure that any passwords are not visible in the github repository. 
    * Add environment variables in the env.py

            
              os.environ.setdefault("IP", "Added by developer")
              os.environ.setdefault("PORT", "Added by developer")
              os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "Added by developer")
              os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_URI", "Added by developer")
              os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_DBNAME", "Added by developer")

   
          
    #### Heroku Deployment


    This project was deployed using Heroku. Heroku is a PAAS (platform as a service) that enables developer to build, run and operate applications entirely in the cloud. Heroku integrates with GitHub to make it easy to deploy code living on GitHub to apps running on Heroku.

    1. In the terminal you must first need to create two files.
     **pip3 freeze -- local > requirements.txt**
      Followed by 
     **echo web: python app.py > Procfile**
      These are needed for Heroku. 
    2. Sign in or create a Heroku account. 
        * Click 'New' on the dashboard and select 'Create new app'.
        * Provide a unique app name including dashes, select your region, and   click  **'Create App'**.

    3. Go to **delpoy** tab on the dashboard.
       * For the **deployment method** click **Github**
       * Provide your repository name and click **Search**, once it finds your repository, click **Connect**.
       * Click on **Settings** and then the **Reveal Config Vars** to provide your **environment variables** from your **env.py** file to **Heroku**:
       
        ENTER IP, PORT, SECRET_KEY, MONGO_URI, MONGO_DBNAME.

    4. Return to your git terminal and Push **requirements.txt** and **Profile**.
        $ git add requirements.txt
        $ git commit -m "Add requirements.txt file."
        $ git add Procfile 
        $ git commit -m "Add procfile."
        $ git push
    5.  Return to **Heroku** and click the **deploy** tab. 
        Then click on **Enable Automatic Deployment** followed by **Deploy Branch (main)**
        This will take less than a minute. Once your receive the success note. Click **view** to see your live site.

### User Stories Testing 

#### First Time User 


 ![Family Recipes homepage on mobile, ipad, ipad pro and desk top.](static/testing/homepage.png) "Family Recipes on multiple displays."

 * User arrives at site and is guided to register. They must register name and password. They are prompted to add letter and not leave blank. 

 ![Family Recipes homepage on mobile, ipad, ipad pro and desk top.](static/testing/register.png) "Family Recipes register page."

 * After registering the user lands on the profile page and allows user to view recipes or add their own. 

  ![Family Recipes homepage on mobile, ipad, ipad pro and desk top.](static/testing/profile.png) "Family Recipes profile page."

  * User looks at recipes and searches for valid recipes. Example entering flour will give you different cakes.

 ![Family Recipes homepage on mobile, ipad, ipad pro and desk top.](static/testing/recipes.png) "Family Recipes profile page."

 * This allows them to search.

  ![Family Recipes homepage on mobile, ipad, ipad pro and desk top.](static/testing/profile.png) "Family Recipes profile page."

  The user can then look at the full recipe and see ingredients listed and whether or not it is gluten free. 

  ![Family Recipes homepage on mobile, ipad, ipad pro and desk top.](static/testing/fullrecipe.png) "Family Recipes profile page."

  While searching the navbar or return ing to the profile the user can add their own recipe.

  ![Family Recipes homepage on mobile, ipad, ipad pro and desk top.](static/testing/addrecipe.png) "Family Recipes profile page."

  The user may fill in the form and add their recipe. They can also use the url image option or use the default image. 

  The user may also delete or edit their own recipes on the full recipe page. Once completed the user may log out.

  All links are working appropriately and leading the user easily around the site. 


## Code Testing


W3C CSS Validator Services was used to validate CSS.

![successful validation confirmation](static/testing/csstest.png) "CSS Validation."
 * This was successful.

 ![successful validation confirmation](static/testing/pep8.png) "Pep8 Python testing."
 * This was successful but there was white space on blank like that would not change.

### Bugs
#### Mongodb

1. The trickiest part is connecting mongodb and to gitpod. The main issue is knowing where to add the name and password to your MONGO_URL. This seemed to have a delayed response for me as it did not initial work but worked the following morning. I use a VPN in China and can cause some glitches. First test didn't work because I had missed a closing " in my html. Once rectified it all worked and stored info in the databases.

#### Images and form
* After adding a flex component to css this cause my images to distort. I removed the flex to specific areas instead. 

 #### Form 
 * The form pushed left on small devices. I removed the width of 400px, which helped and then targeted the media query on larger devices. 

 #### Home Page
 * I had a link to the recipes which allowed the user to bypass login and register. I removed this from the site.
